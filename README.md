# SMB_ROM_hack
Nes ROM Hack of Super Mario Bros edited by Nintendo. In this version of the game, Mario doesn't have a cap, there are far fewer enemies, the game is much easier (the levels are revisited to make them much more accessible so the game can be completed in one go) and the goombas have a stupid skin.
